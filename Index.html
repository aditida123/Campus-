    <h1>In the year 1964, Campus School came into existence. The Indian Institute of Technology is situated far away from the Kanpur city. The scarcity of any good school nearby, the I.I.T administration decided to set up Campus School. They planned to start their own private school in order to provide best possible elementary education to the wards of its faculty & employees. Initially it was housed in a type IV house and there were very few children. The Kanpur Indo-American Programme took an active initiative in the running and planning of the school programme, curriculum and architecture of its building. In the beginning, Principal Central School was given the responsibility to see the day to day administration of the school. Later Mr. S.L. Gupta took up the job as coordinator’ of the school. In the last 40 years the school was headed by Principal J.N. Mattoo, Prof. P.P. Shah, Mrs. A. Raha & Mrs. R. Dhar. It is currently administered by Mrs. Achla Josan.

Over the years the school blossomed from small group to a full-grown school.

In the year 1972 the staff of the school was absorbed on regular scale & few teachers became permanent employees of the institute. Now it is a full fledged school and an important unit of the institute. It follows CBSE pattern of education with an emphasis on moral education, computers & personality development.</h1>

    <h1>We started sharing text and study material since 20 April 2020 and from 1July 2020
online classes and interactive sessions have started. We feel that it is time to start with the
evaluation /assessment process to motivate and to retain the interest of the students. It is also
very uncertain as to when we will be able to resume normal school. Broadly speaking we will be
conducting assessment tests through Google Forms, Whats App, recorded videos, assignment
and activities. A detailed plan comprising of schedule, bifurcation of marks, syllabus will be
shared and the assessments will be conducted accordingly. We intend to restrain our self from
distributing the regular Achievement Record this academic session but will certainly share the
learning experience of the child by the end of the year. The above mentioned plan has been
prepared keeping in mind the prevailing situation and we will modify it according to directives
of the Government of India in future.
